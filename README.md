## Work in Progress (like everything else)

This will not work for anyone else because the models are missing.

Sorry.

Put models in `./models/` and Google Speech data needs to be in `./data/speech/`.


Install:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:src"


Start server:

    python server.py
